# Ticket-Reservation-App

"Microservices", a trending buzz word nowadays. Many organizations nowadays are migrating from monolithic application to micro-services based application.
In this project you gonna find out how how multiple services run independently leveraging on the best microservices patterns to enable scale, performance and resilience. Tough the project is having limited functionaity but its backend implementaion is very very huge.

# Use-case
This application has 7 different services. Each of the service has its own mongoDB database respectively. All these services are converted into Docker image and then pushed into kubernetes container and further the traffic is controlled using nginx. I have implemented messagaing queue system using NATS-streaming for inter communication within services.
